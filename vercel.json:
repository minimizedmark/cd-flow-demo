{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "next build"
}
```

## 2. **Root Cause Explanation**

**What was actually happening:**
- Your Next.js app built successfully (you can see the build output with routes and sizes)
- Vercel then looked for a directory called `public` to serve as the output
- It couldn't find `public` because Next.js outputs to `.next`, not `public`

**What it needed to do:**
- Recognize this is a Next.js project and look in `.next` for the build output
- Or follow explicit configuration pointing to the correct directory

**The misconception:**
Vercel was treating your project as a static site (which outputs to `public`) rather than a Next.js application (which outputs to `.next`). This happens when:
- Framework preset is set incorrectly
- You have conflicting configuration
- Vercel's auto-detection failed

## 3. **Underlying Concept**

**Why this error exists:**
Different frameworks output their builds to different directories:
- **Static sites** → `public/`, `dist/`, `build/`
- **Next.js** → `.next/`
- **Create React App** → `build/`
- **Vite** → `dist/`

Vercel needs to know where to find your built files to deploy them to their edge network.

**The correct mental model:**

Think of the build process as two distinct steps:
```
Step 1: BUILD
Your source code → Build process → Output directory
(src/app/)       (next build)     (.next/)

Step 2: DEPLOY
Output directory → Vercel reads files → Deploy to edge
(.next/)            ✓ Found!          → Live!
